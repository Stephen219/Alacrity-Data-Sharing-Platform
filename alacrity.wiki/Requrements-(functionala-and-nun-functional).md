##  Overview

**Alacrity** is a secure, no-code platform that enables organisations to upload healthcare datasets in CSV format for encrypted analysis by researchersâ€”without the data ever leaving the platform. It supports statistical analysis, research submission workflows, secure communication, and monetisation of premium datasets.

This document outlines the core **functional** and **non-functional** requirements for the platform.

##  Functional Requirements (FR)

###  Dataset Management and Access

**FR1.** The system shall allow organisations to upload datasets in CSV format including a name, description, and field information (name and data type).  
**FR2.** The system shall allow organisations to assign tags to datasets for improved discoverability.  
**FR3.** The system shall allow researchers to search for datasets using keywords and tags.  
**FR4.** The system shall allow researchers to filter search results by dataset size, tags, and upload date.  
**FR5.** The system shall allow organisations to view all access requests made by researchers.  
**FR6.** The system shall allow organisations to approve or reject dataset access requests.  
**FR7.** The system shall allow researchers to access datasets only after approval from the organisation.  
**FR8.** The system shall allow users to download homomorphically encrypted datasets for secure offline analysis.

###  Data Analysis

**FR9.** The system shall allow researchers to perform descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode) on approved datasets.  
**FR10.** The system shall allow researchers to perform inferential statistical tests (t-tests, chi-square, ANOVA).  
**FR11.** The system shall allow researchers to perform correlational analysis (Pearson, Spearman).  
**FR12.** The system shall provide tools for automatic dataset filtering, cleaning, aggregation, and normalisation.

###  Research Workflow

**FR13.** The system shall allow researchers to submit research findings with a name, process description, raw results, and a summary.  
**FR14.** The system shall allow organisations to review and approve or reject submitted research.  
**FR15.** The system shall allow researchers to publish validated research outputs.  
**FR16.** The system shall allow researchers to set visibility of their published research to either public or private.  
**FR17.** The system shall allow users (researchers, organisations, unauthenticated users) to search through published research outputs.

###  User Management and Collaboration

**FR18.** The system shall allow researchers to register an account to use the platform.  
**FR19.** The system shall allow researchers to bookmark datasets for future reference.  
**FR20.** The system shall allow organisations to create and manage additional user accounts.  
**FR21.** The system shall allow organisations to revoke researcher access to any dataset.  
**FR22.** The system shall allow organisations to view dataset usage metrics such as access and analysis count.  
**FR23.** The system shall allow researchers to chat with other researchers for collaboration.  
**FR24.** The system shall allow researchers to chat directly with the organisation administrators.  
**FR25.** The system shall allow researchers to follow other researchers to stay updated on their research activities.  
**FR26.** The system shall allow researchers to follow organisations to receive dataset or publication updates.

###  Monetisation and Premium Features

**FR27.** The system shall allow organisations to mark specific datasets as premium.  
**FR28.** The system shall allow researchers to make payments to access premium datasets before analysis.

**FR29.** Add notification system (in-app and email) for dataset approvals, rejections, and research updates.

**FR30.** The system should have a secure role based authetication for roles organisation reseacherr and contributers

##  Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

**NFR1.** The system shall use homomorphic encryption to ensure all dataset processing occurs securely without revealing raw data.  
**NFR2.** The platform shall ensure that datasets never leave the platform in an unencrypted form.  
**NFR3.** The system shall enforce role-based access control (RBAC) for researchers, organisations, and administrators.  
**NFR4.** The system shall support horizontal scalability to accommodate large datasets and concurrent users.  
**NFR5.** The platform shall maintain 99.9% uptime for high availability.  
**NFR6.** The frontend built with Next.js and TailwindCSS shall be responsive across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  
**NFR7.** Dataset uploads and analysis actions shall be processed within 5 seconds for datasets up to 1 GB.  
**NFR8.** The backend system, developed using Django and deployed via Docker, shall ensure consistent performance across environments.  
**NFR9.** The system shall support CSV files with up to 1 million rows and 100 columns per dataset.  
**NFR10.** Search queries for datasets and research shall return results within 2 seconds under normal load.  
**NFR11.** The system shall retain all dataset and research metadata for a minimum of 5 years for auditability and compliance.  
**NFR12.** The platform shall provide secure payment processing for premium dataset access.  
**NFR13.** The system shall maintain end-to-end encryption for all chat messages between users.  
**NFR14.** The platform shall log all data access, analysis actions, and transactions for traceability.  
**NFR15.** The system shall comply with relevant data protection regulations including GDPR.

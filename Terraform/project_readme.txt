# Anything else
If there is anything else that I would need to copy and paste during Project setup please include it here

# Project - JUnit
To evidence that JUnit has run on your Project server I would like you to output the name of your unit tests(s) and whether they have passed or failed to the terminal window and note in your readme file when in the video I can find that evidence e.g. 1m30s

# Project - Checkstyle
To evidence that Checkstyle has run on your Project server I would like you to output the name of the Checkstyle rules that your code violates to the terminal window and note in your readme file when in the video I can find that evidence e.g. 1m30s
